## Overview

In this section, I provide an overview of key considerations for improving your project.

- First Name and Last Name: The alert message related to the `first name` and `last name` should clearly specify that user input is expected to be in uppercase.

- Password Length: The error message associated with the `password` input field should also mention that a minimum length of `8` characters is required.



## Variable Naming

In this section, I'll address the importance of variable naming in your code.

- Descriptive Variable Names: Ensure that variable names used in your code are descriptive and self-explanatory. They should be easy to understand and should align with the `id` or `class` names used in the HTML file.

- Consistency: Maintain consistency in your variable names throughout your code. Whether you choose `camelCase` or another naming style, stick to it.

## Responsive Design

In this section, I'll provide tips for improving responsiveness.

- Media Queries: Both mobile and desktop displays have alignment issues with input boxes, the sign-in button, and the container. Consider using flexbox since you have a container to address these alignment issues.

- Media Queries: Desktop and Mobile display have been adjusted base on your observation.
